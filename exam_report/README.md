# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is auto
generated in the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image to
the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

will generate an `.html` page of your report. After deadline for answering this template, we will autoscrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate an `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final handin.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

will check your answers in this template against the constrains listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, have you included an image when asked to.

For both functions to work it is important that you do not rename anything. The script have two dependencies that can
be installed with `pip install click markdown`.

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustic* which means that it includes everything that you could possible do on the project in
relation the curricilum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked of all boxes at the
end of the project.

> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

 We used Pytorch as overall framework in our project, since it's one of the most use in the machine learning field and the one we were the most familiar with. To load our pretrained model we used the ultralytics.nn.Module from ultralytics 

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

 I would suggest a new team member to create a dedicated conda environment using the requirements.txt file avaible in the repository

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. Did you fill out every folder or only a subset?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
> Answer:

From the cookie-cutter template we have filled the src train_model.py file with the code to load our model and we have also filled the data foler with the script to dowload the data. Lastly we have filled the reports folder with the images reporting basic statistics from our model.  

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? Additionally, explain with your own words why these**
> **concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Answer:

As general rules we tried to comment as much as possible and used very descriptive names when creating functions. Our group wasn't very large, but these concepts matter because they ensure the code and the overall project are more readable and understendable for everyone. 

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

In total we have implemented five test. The tests focuses on the data and the model. In the test script regarding the data we test if the total number of images matches an expected amount, label format(if the labels are correctly matches with the respective images) and if the images are RGB or not. In the model test script we tested for the computional time and resources used by our model and the status of the enviroment(online or offline). 

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If you code had an code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

Some of our scripts had a covarage of 100%(test_model.py), while another one (test_data.py) had a coverage 60%. Even for the test_model.py script which had a coverage of 100% we don't trust it to be error free because a 100% coverage just means that all the lines of code are actually run when the tests are executed, not that the script is bug free.  

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, we had branches to upload new important files. In general it is good practice to crate a new branch and not push on the main repository. Also pull request are important for the cooperation of the group because not everyone could be okay with the new changes and it allows to isolate your changes from the main codebase. This is crucial when working on bug fixes or experiments since it prevents an unstable code from affecting the stability of the main project. 

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
>
> Answer:

We tried to use DVC for data version control but we encouter an error that we were not able to overcome when trying to execute the dvc pull command. In general it is beneficial to have a data version control setup because especially in data science and machine learning project often involve collaboration among team members and different team members might be working on different aspects of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development. Data version control ensures that everyone works with the same dataset version. 

### Question 11

> **Discuss you continues integration setup. What kind of CI are you running (unittesting, linting, etc.)? Do you test**
> **multiple operating systems, python version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free to insert a link to one of**
> **your github actions workflow.**
>
> Answer length: 200-300 words.
>
> Example:
> *We have organized our CI into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing and one for running*
> *... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen here: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

We have organized our CI into 2 separate files: one ensures that our tests runs in a clean and consistent environment across the three main different opearting systems(Linux, Windows, MacOs) while the other one automates the process of building a docker image and pushing it to Docker Hub whenever there's a push to the master branch or any pull request, ensuring that the docker image is always up-to-date with the latest code changes. 

## Running code and tracking experiments

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
> especially the reproducibility of your experiments.

### Question 12

> **How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would**
> **run a experiment.**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: python my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25*
>
> Answer:

We used a config file where we define the path to the dataset and the classes for object detection given the context of YOLO, since we did not train the model we did not had to set the hyperparamters. I would run our project by ensuring that dataset.yaml file is in the same folder as my make_dataset.py and than run the python script. 
```
python src/data/make_dataset.py
```

### Question 13

> **Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information**
> **is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment*
> *one would have to do ...*
>
> Answer:

--- We made use of config files. Whenever our project is tun the followig happens: the dataset is downloaded from the VisDrone2019 website, the train, test and val folder are created. To reproduce an experiment create a conda enviroment with the requirements.txt file, dowload the dataset and run the src/model/train_model.py file ---

### Question 14

> **Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&B (or another experiment tracking**
> **service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take**
> **inspiration from [this figure](figures/wandb.png). Explain what metrics you are tracking and why they are**
> **important.**
>
> Answer length: 200-300 words + 1 to 3 screenshots.
>
> Example:
> *As seen in the first image when have tracked ... and ... which both inform us about ... in our experiments.*
> *As seen in the second image we are also tracking ... and ...*
>
> Answer:

this image shows different graphs representing the gpu usage during the training of the model on our costum dataset. As we can seen the most usage of the GPU is at the beginning of the training when the model and the data are allocated to the workers threads. 
![Gpu_time](https://github.com/irisdaniaj/MLOps_project/assets/68902693/fe4be3f1-8398-4a88-877f-491d8043662b) 
this image shows the precision recall curve of the model on our dataset.

### Question 15

> **Docker is an important tool for creating containerized applications. Explain how you used docker in your**
> **experiments? Include how you would run your docker images and include a link to one of your docker files.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *For our project we developed several images: one for training, inference and deployment. For example to run the*
> *training docker image: `docker run trainer:latest lr=1e-3 batch_size=64`. Link to docker file: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

To run our Docker images, we followed these general steps; we created a dockerfile that specified the base image, the files to include in the Docker image, and the default command to run. We used the docker build command to create a Docker image from the Dockerfile, once the image was built, we ran it using the docker run command. <https://github.com/irisdaniaj/MLOps_project/blob/main/Dockerfile> ---

### Question 16

> **When running into bugs while trying to run your experiments, how did you perform debugging? Additionally, did you**
> **try to profile your code or do you think it is already perfect?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used ... and others used ... . We did a single profiling*
> *run of our main code at some point that showed ...*
>
> Answer:

Since we all used VSCode as editor when running in a bug we used the bebugging function in VSCode. We did a profiling run on our YOLOv8 model, collecting various metrics related to execution time, memory usage and tensor shapes. The profiling results showed that the "aten::uniform_" function which is a uniform random number generation function, accounts for a significant portion of the CPU time in your profiling results. The function that used the less amount of time was the "aten::view" function which is associated with changing the shape of tensors.  

## Working in the cloud

> Answer:

Locally we build an API which can be used to do inference by uploading an image. If someone wants to do this it is necessary to follow these steps: \
on the directory of the repository run the application.py file

```
python application.py 
```
then run
```
uvicorn --reload --port 8000 application:app
```
and finally copy this link to Chrome `http://localhost:8000/docs`

The starting point of our diagram is Conda which we use to set the enviroment and retrieve all the requirements. Moving on to our Pytorch application, we get the model from ultralytics, we use Hydra and Weight and Bias respectely for manage hyperparamets and experiment tracking. Everything in a Docker following the Cookiecutter structure. To perform Continuos integration the project has been pushed to a Github repo. We also constructed an API for user inference. 

### Question 26

> Example:
> *The biggest challenges in the project was using ... tool to do ... . The reason for this was ...*
>
> Answer:

The biggest challanges in the project were using dvc for data version control, using fastapi and building images with docker. As stated before due to technical issues we were not able to implent data version control in our project. We had to do some research to let anyone be able to build docker images with our dockerfile. In addition, getting our fastapi.py script was a big challenge and we really had to deep dive into the web framework's code to solve our bugs. 

### Question 27
