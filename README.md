# MLOps_project

This repository contains the group project work for the MLOps course at LMU Munich. 


**1 Overall goal**: The goal is to perform object segmentation on images.\
**2 Framework:** As a framework [PyTorch Image Models](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models) was used. It contains models, scripts and pre trained for a lot of state-of-the-art image models within computer vision.\
**3 Data:** We train our model on the [Citiscape Dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/downloads/) dataset. It focuses on the on semantic understanding of urban street scenes. It contains 25.000 images from 50 cities and 30 labels. If you want to download the dataset you have to register in the website first. \
**4 Deep Learning model used:**  We used the [Ultralytics YOLOv8 model](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).
